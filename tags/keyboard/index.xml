      <description>In the last build log, I was stuck with three dead switches on the right side of the keyboard. Using my pliers and pulling hard, I extracted all three of them. For two of them, I saw the problem immediately. One of the two pins on the switches was bent. They were easily bent back into shape with pliers. Then, I re-inserted them into their hotswap sockets. They started working with no further complaints.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this series, I went through the process of selecting a split keyboard. I decided to go with the Lily58. Now that the PCBs had arrived, I began to assemble the keyboard with some trepidation. The following build guides were quite helpful:
 kata0518&amp;rsquo;s buildguide_en.md - the original build guide  I found out too late that the keyhive build guide I was using was outdated and missing some pictures.</description>

      <description>My journey with mechanical keyboards began when I was an intern at a Big Chip Company TM. My coworker had just bought a Poker 2 and I was mesmerized by the precise and delicate &amp;ldquo;shicks&amp;rdquo; it produced, not to mention its sleek and compact profile.
Upon landing my first job, I bought my first mech keyboard, a KeyCool 84 with early Kailh brown switches. I was deeply disappointed - it was clunky and cheap feeling compared to the Poker.</description>
