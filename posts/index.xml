      <description>My journey with mechanical keyboards began when I was an intern at a Big Chip Company TM. My coworker had just bought a Poker 2 and I was mesmerized by the precise and delicate &amp;ldquo;shicks&amp;rdquo; it produced, not to mention its sleek and compact profile.

This is somewhat backwards compared to infix notation, which normal humans are used to, as well as prefix (aka &amp;ldquo;Polish&amp;rdquo;) notation, which is used in Lisp and other languages.</description>
