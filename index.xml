      <description>Long ago in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, the geeks of yore wielded RPN calculators such as the HP-42S at the local diner. Calculating tips since has never been so cool.
But what is RPN? RPN stands for &amp;ldquo;Reverse Polish Notation&amp;rdquo;, a syntax where operands are given before the operator. This is somewhat backwards compared to infix notation, which normal humans are used to, as well as prefix (aka &amp;ldquo;Polish&amp;rdquo;) notation, which is used in Lisp and other languages.</description>

      <description>Many developers, new and old, curse git from the depths of their bowels. However, once you get past the learning curve, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly fun to tinker and automate common git tasks. The following are a collection of bash functions and aliases that accelerate my workflow considerably:
glS &amp;ldquo;git pickaxe with filter&amp;rdquo;
A lot of magic occurs when you combine fuzzy finders with git. But first,

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Daniel Ting! Welcome to Super Pork Chop, my blog.
As a senior worker bee in a distant land of fire and ice, I teach young roombas the errors of their ways, so they may one day be released into the wild. Half of the time, I&amp;rsquo;m like one of those horrible deep sea creatures that stay after 5:30 and dwell in the depths of Engineering, debugging nameless things. The rest of the time I float around in the clouds, sending email through the atmosphere and holding my nose while writing bash scripts.</description>
